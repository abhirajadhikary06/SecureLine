# Women Safety & Crime Detection

## Mission
- To protect women from harassment.
- To detect criminals involved in harassment cases.

## Vision
- To create a safer environment for women using technology-driven solutions.
- To provide an anonymous and reliable platform for reporting crimes.
- To leverage machine learning for crime pattern analysis and prevention.

## Strengths
- **Anonymous Reporting:** Allows users to report harassment cases anonymously, reducing personal risk.
- **Engaging Frontend:** User-friendly interface for better accessibility.
- **Robust Backend:** Efficient and secure system handling reports and data management.
- **Real-Time Crime Maps:** Displays continuously updated crime locations and statistics.
- **Predictive Safety Map:** Uses Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) Machine Learning Model to highlight unsafe areas.

## Weaknesses
- **Upvote Feature Limitation:** The feature to validate crime data is currently non-functional since it requires login, which contradicts our goal of maintaining anonymity.

## Opportunities
- **Implementation of Upvote Feature:** Can be reworked to allow anonymous validation of reported crimes.
- **Integration with Law Enforcement:** Connecting reports directly with authorities for faster action.
- **AI-driven Analysis:** Enhancing predictions with deeper machine learning models.

## Threats
- **Data Integrity Risks:** Potential misuse of the anonymous reporting system with fake reports.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Ensuring data security while maintaining user anonymity.
- **Legal & Ethical Challenges:** Compliance with law enforcement and ethical considerations in data collection.
